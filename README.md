# MySQL-Practice
This code snippet represents a series of interactions within a MySQL session.
It includes operations such as creating databases, creating tables, modifying table structures, inserting data, and altering columns. The user interacts with the MySQL monitor, executing SQL commands to manage databases and tables, encountering and resolving errors along the way. The session involves creating a table named "stagiaire" (later renamed to "stag"), performing various alterations including column additions, renames, and modifications, as well as data insertion and manipulation.
